# How You Can Contribute

Timetracker is an open source project maintained by brothers [Matt](https://github.com/mateowatson) and [Blake](https://github.com/blakewatson) Watson. We welcome input in the form of filing an issue in the [issue tracker on Github](https://github.com/mateowatson/timetracker/issues). If you would like to contribute code, you may also make a pull request [through GitHub](https://github.com/mateowatson/timetracker).

## Issue tracker

Go to the [Github issue tracker](https://github.com/mateowatson/timetracker/issues) and click New Issue. Write a succinct but descriptive title and a description with as much specific information as possible. Generally, issues are either to report a bug, a coding error or typo, a feature request, or a question. This is the preferred way to submit an issue, but you may also email the creator of Timetracker, Matt Watson, at matt@mattwatson.org.

## Pull request (PR)

Make a pull request to the `master` branch. We have not been using the `develop` branch lately. Stable commits for production purposes are tagged with semver tags, as well as added in Github under "Releases."
